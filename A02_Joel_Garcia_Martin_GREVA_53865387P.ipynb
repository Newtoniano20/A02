    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the Netflix adaptation of The Three-Body Problem book series, the protagonists attempt to send a preserved human brain into space to intercept an incoming alien fleet. Their goal is to accelerate the probe containing the brain to approximately 1% lightspeed (c=3x10^8 m/s) in order to reach the fleet within a reasonable timeframe. The idea behind the Staircase Project is to propel the probe using a series of nuclear explosions to transfer the momentum of the plasma ejected to a solar sail. In this assignment, we will study the feasibility of this project from a structural point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Estimation of the thrust force\n",
    "To make an estimation of the thrust force we will make the following assumptions:\n",
    "- Each detonation ejects mp=4.468 x 10^6 kg of plasma (more or less equivalent to a 10-megaton explosion).\n",
    "- The plasma is released within tp=0.1 seconds in all directions as a sinusoidal pulse (half-period) advancing at a speed of Vp = 125000 km/s (see Figure 1).\n",
    "- The plasma pulse reaches the probe at a distance d = 200 km.\n",
    "- The total mass of the probe and solar sail is  kg, and the pusher plate surface is S = 900 m^2."

Stresses are also very high for this kind of material, so the conclusion on how to improve this design is to add more nodes or increase the material strength or area of those in the sail. The bar that handles most of the pressure is the one between node 1 and 6 in Figure 1, which is also where the sail broke in the movie (some of the bolts got loose).\n",
